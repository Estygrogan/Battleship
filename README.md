# Battleship

Battleship is a timeless game which was made using a terminal in Python.

## Features

Computer Opponent: Can play a full game of Battleship against the computer.

Full Input Readability: When fully functional, the terminal will let you input coordinates, tell you if you guessed right or wrong, if an input is invalid etc.

Future Plans: Fully implment score system, which I was unable to do before submission.

## Testing

Code was validated through the [CI Python Code Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/#), where any identified syntax and whitespace errors were resolved

Testing was conducted in the Gitpod terminal to highlight any persistent issues, which will be detailed in the Bugs section. Once an issue was identified, depending on the scale, it was investigates. Firstly, I  would compare using the CI content and other online sources, such as W3S, the CI slack etc. If I was having a particularly serious issue, I would attempt to resolve it with one of our mentor meetings.

## Unfixed Bugs

play_game function is not working as intended, which I believe is causing the rest of the code to break. Have found no solution to resolve this as of now.

## Deployment

After I was satisfied with my work in Gitpod, I then pushed my work to Github. The website was then deployed via Heroku.

## Credits

Content: Project was based on the Board class given in the sample Portfolio Project 3 video. A significant chunk of the new_game function was also based on that video, though adapted in some parts in order to duits this project. Any other functions were made by myself, using what I've learned from CI lessons and resources such as [W3S Schhols](https://www.w3schools.com/)

Extra Help: Some general questions of mine for the project were answered directly in the Slack channels, as well as through channel search.
